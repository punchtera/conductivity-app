## Problem 

Create a web application that evaluates N * N of `0` and `1` values to identify and visualize a continuous conductive path from the top to the bottom. A conductive path is a contiguous sequence of the digit `1` that connects the top edge of the grid to the bottom edge. The path may progress from one cell to another vertically (up or down) or horizontally (left or right), but no diagonally. Each cell in the path must share a common side with the next cell in the sequence. The app must also provide a UI for user input and maintain and display a history of evaluations.  

# Conductivity App

## How to Execute the Application

Install Node.js if not already installed. 

- First run the server, running in bash `npm run start` inside the server folder

- Second run the client react application, running in bash `npm run start` inside the client folder

- Navigate to _http:localhost:3000_ and interact with the interface.
